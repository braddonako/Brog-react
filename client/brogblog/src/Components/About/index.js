                <p> Yo yo yo.These about me sections really kinda suck.I should probably start doing a podcast or some shit cause I am the WORST writer.I can talk fo sure tho.ANYWAY, I grew up in Colorado, I was super lucky to have amazing parents that supported me and my other two siblings with our goals in life.Seriously, no way in hell would I be where I am today without them.Hockey is something I am passionate about and it was my life from 5 years of age till I graduated high school.Once the college decision rolled around, it was time to decide between going to school or continuing hockey.The very last minute I decided I would hang up the skates and go to Colorado State University.I wasn 't much of a student in highschool, really just took care of hockey. I really, really did not like college at first. It was a HUGE adjustment for me. Being a full time student and all. At least in HS I had hockey, and all the classes were a cake walk. I mean, I enjoy learning, but the whole envoironment of me sitting there and listening to a professor blab on about shit I didnt care about never really appealed to me. I left CSU, and attended University of Northern Colorado. This was a great change for me and I changed my mindset on how I approached school. I started getting better grades, and met a great group of friends. I graduated in the Summer of 2017 with a degree in Business Management. I broke my knee shortly after, (Long story, but a golf cart flipped on me) then got a job as an Account Manager with this Company called Apex Systems. I started there on December 4th, 2017. I started in sales, then went a recruiter, then wanted to get back into sales, then quit. I just had a little stint at a startup called Pax8. Even though it was a 3 month period of time, I met such amazing people there. Even though we weren'
                t an early startup, the culture was unreal.They have had tremendous growth and it is so cool to see how excited everyone gets about the company growing.Which makes me want to work
                for a startup again at somepoint, or create one.hmmmmm.We will see! </p>
